# Patient_waiting_List_Dashboard

Creating a dashboard to visualize the waiting list of patients, categorized as inpatient and outpatient, segmented by specialty, can provide valuable insights for healthcare management. 
Include general statistics about the total number of patients on the waiting list, the distribution between inpatient and outpatient, and maybe some key metrics like average wait time.
Allow users to filter the data based on various parameters such as specialty, department, date range, etc. This will make the dashboard more interactive and useful for different stakeholders. #fpna #powebi #data
